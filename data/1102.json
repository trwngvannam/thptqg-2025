      "passage": "When several farmers merge plots into a single \"project farm\", they use digital tools to make that teamwork far more effective. GPS mapping, drones, and in-field sensors build a live, shared picture of soil types, weather shifts, and plant growth. Because everyone works on the same data, the team can settle seeding dates, determine when to spray, and track machinery in real time. What once depended on guesswork is now driven by verifiable information.\n\nWith GPS technology, farmers can accurately map out their fields and create customised planting plans. Seeding machines change their rate on the fly, drones spray pests on targeted zones, and smart spreaders apply fertiliser only where data shows a need. Because inputs go exactly where they help, fields yield more while chemical runoff falls. Trials report considerable savings on seed, fuel, and sprays – benefits the partners split at the season's end.\n\nWater management is just as precise. Specialised equipment tracks moisture every hour, and forecast apps predict rain, wind, or heatwaves. Automated pumps deliver measured water amounts to thirsty zones and stop when a storm is coming, slashing waste and energy bills. The result is steadier yields in dry years, fewer nutrients washed away, and a smaller water footprint for the whole partnership. Smart irrigation also helps limit weed growth, reducing herbicide use.\n\nThe journey from field to market is equally digital. Cloud platforms record harvest weights, storage temperatures, and shipment times the moment they change, while blockchain records freeze each entry so customers can rely on it. Analytic tools browse the records to indicate weak points in the procedure, forecast prices, and suggest better planting plans for the next season to project partners. This makes project farming both profitable and sustainable.\n\n(Adapted from https://www.consumersearch.com)",

Investors, eager to protect short-term returns, frequently applaud these surface-level initiatives, reinforcing the cycle. [III] No sector illustrates the issue better than oil and gas. Having realised that denying climate science now backfires, the industry has swapped denial for \"green\" paint. Press releases trumpet potential renewable ventures while drilling plans expand unabated.\n\nWhy does this matter? Greenwashing and climate denial share a core objective: to postpone the deep emission cuts claimed by scientists as urgent this decade. [IV] Whereas denial disputes the crisis, greenwashing misleads the public into believing problems are solved, thereby eroding consumer advocacy of genuine environmental actions and stalling regulatory reforms. In effect, it acts as a soothing lullaby, guiding society ever closer to ecological breakdown while fostering a false sense of progress. Exposing the facade – and insisting on verifiable, measurable carbon reductions – is essential if rhetoric is to give way to real action.\n\n(Adapted from https://www.greenpeace.org.uk)",

        "A. Greenwashing is surging as firms cover ongoing pollution in eco-friendly rhetoric, distracting the public and postponing the deep emission cuts scientists deem urgent.",
        "B. High-emitting sectors follow the trend of greenwashing, boasting about promising renewable ventures in press releases while quietly going on damaging the environment.",
        "C. Instead of investing in meaningful decarbonisation, major emitters have a tendency to opt for denying the claim of \"carbon-neutral\" or \"net-zero\" on their product lines.",
        "D. Once a prevalent strategy of corporations in response to public scrutiny, climate denial is losing its effectiveness and has to be replaced by greenwashing."
