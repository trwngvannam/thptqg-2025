      "passage": "The concept of project farming, where farmers come together to collaborate on large-scale agricultural projects, has gained significant traction, and modern technology keeps this collaboration on track. Advanced technologies such as GPS, sensors, drones, and data analytics are used to optimise agricultural practices. Additionally, the collected real-time data on soil conditions, weather patterns, and plant growth enables farmers to accelerate the decision-making process that maximises productivity while minimising resource waste.\n\nGPS technology allows farmers to precisely map out their fields and create customised planting plans. This ensures that seeds are sown at optimal locations based on soil characteristics and previous yield data. By avoiding areas with poor fertility, farmers can increase their overall crop yield. Camera traps provide advance warnings of insects, so farmers do not have to treat the whole field. This, therefore, helps curb chemical runoff and save money for every party involved in the project.\n\nTechnology also plays a vital role in optimising irrigation practices for sustainable agriculture. Specialised equipment reports dryness hour by hour, and weather apps forecast rain for the week ahead. Automated valves give each zone exactly the water it needs and pause when clouds are approaching. This cuts pumping costs and protects groundwater while keeping the crop healthy. On dry continents, such savings keep projects economically viable.\n\nThe digital trail does not stop at the farm gate. Cloud platforms let project farmers, processors, and truck drivers input harvest weights, storage temperatures, and delivery times the moment they change, while blockchain records freeze each entry so customers can trust it. Analytic tools combine seasons of records to forecast demand, spot price opportunities, and mark weak points in the workflow. This allows project farmers to anticipate market demand, exploit resource allocation, and plan for potential challenges.\n\n(Adapted from https://www.consumersearch.com)",

Such corporate sleight of hand has become so pervasive that regulators in Europe and the United States are scrambling to tighten rules on environmental claims, yet enforcement still lags behind marketing creativity. [II] The fossil-fuel sector exemplifies the issue. After decades covertly sowing doubt about climate science, oil and gas giants have grasped that direct denial is reputationally toxic. They have therefore swapped their denial tactics for a \"green\" paint-sprayer, trumpeting token investments in renewables while expanding drilling.\n\nWhy does this matter? Greenwashing and climate denial share a core objective: to postpone the emissions cuts urgently required to avert climate breakdown. [III] Whereas denial invites opposition, greenwashing lulls the public into believing problems are already solved. Under this collective illusion, pressure on high-emitting firms evaporates and the radical decisions needed to transform energy, transport, and food systems are delayed indefinitely. [IV] Greenwashing thus acts as a soothing lullaby, leading society toward ecological ruin with a tune of comforting half-truths. Exposing this deception is essential if clichés are to be replaced by real, measurable emission cuts.\n\n(Adapted from https://www.greenpeace.org.uk)",

        "A. Greenwashing has now been pervading everyday products and services, raising customers' awareness of the urgent need to maintain sustainable developments.",
        "B. Major emitters have opted for open climate denials in preference to more sophisticated greenwashing to preserve profits and reputation instead of reforming their core operations.",
        "C. A new wave of greenwashing allows corporations to hide ongoing pollution behind reassuring eco-labels, diverting scrutiny from the rapid emission cuts considered vital by scientists.",
        "D. Greenwashing has significantly grown in its scale and sophistication since its emergence, attracting considerable attention of both the general public and policymakers worldwide."
